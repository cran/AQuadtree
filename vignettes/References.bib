@article{Lagonigro2017,
abstract = {Methods to preserve confidentiality when publishing geographic information conflict with the need to publish accurate data. The goal of this paper is to create a European geographic grid frame-work to disseminate statistical data over maps. We propose a methodology based on quadtree hierarchical geographic data structures. We create a varying size grid adapted to local area densities. High populated zones are disaggregated in small squares to allow dissemination of accurate data. Alternatively, information on low populated zones is published in big squares to avoid identification of individual data. The methodology has been applied to the 2014 population register data in Catalonia.},

The report follows the structure of the production chain for statistics in a statistical office to underline the GEOSTAT1B project partners' emphasis on the importance of integrating the geographical component into the statistical production system. The report will bring you as a reader from the first phase of user needs analysis to the final phase of dissemination. The project has along the action generated a series of guidelines and training material beneficial to the whole European Statistical System (ESS). The deliverables discussed by the whole of the project consortium are placed in appendices, while individual contributions and other relevant material are referred to with hyperlinks.},
